🌟 I am thrilled to share with you a New E-COMMERCE App



The KleineYt app targets people who are looking to buy high-quality furniture products for their house e.g.: cupboards, and chairs. It targets merchants that sell furniture products to enable them to spread their markets and put their products online so everyone can check them out and order them.


💡 Libraries and technologies used : 


Navigation component: one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.

Firebase Auth: Managing Accounts/Logging in and Registrations.

Firebase Firestore: Database for the system.

Firebase Storage: To store product images and user profile pictures.

MVVM & LiveData: Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

Coroutines: do some code in the background.

view binding: instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

Glide: Catch images and load them in imageView.

localization: Support multiple languages
